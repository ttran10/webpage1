            <p>The Grand Junction Neonatal Intensive Care Unit offers comprehensive neonatal 
               diagnostic and treatment facilities for critically ill newborns. We're dedicated 
               to providing the highest quality care for all newborns, ranging from healthy 
               neonates to sick or premature newborns requiring close observation or intensive care.
            </p>
            <p>All of the neonatologists are board certified. We believe it's critical that our 
               clinicians learn about the latest advances in neonatal intensive care to
               better serve the community of Grand Junction.
