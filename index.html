         <h2>Biography</h2>
         <p>
            Dr. Tran received his Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Oregon State University in 2010. Prior to joining Sullivan University, Dr. Tran worked as a Research Scientist (InfoBeyond), Postdoctoral Scholar (Arizona State University) and Postdoctoral Associate (University of Louisville). Dr. Tran has conducted extensive research on network coding based techniques, where he proposed new approaches to improve the efficiency and security of transmission protocols in data networks. He has published several research papers at major IEEE conferences and transactions (<a href = "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mzJnQRcAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1" target="_blank">Google Scholar Citations</a>). He won the <b>best paper award runner-up</b> at the 19th IEEE International Conference on Computer Communication Networks (ICCCN), 2010 and <b>co-recepient of the Jack Neubauer Memorial award</b> for the Best Systems Paper Published in IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 2012.
            
            <br></br>
            
            Dr. Tran’s research mainly lies in the broad area of information systems, machine learning, data mining and big data processing, distributed computing and cybersecurity in data networks. He has proposed many award-winning projects in information and networking technologies supported by NSF, NASA, DoD, and DoE. Dr. Tran was the Session Chair of the IEEE ICCCN 2009 and Workshop Co-chair of the Big Data workshop of the 5th International Conference on Cyber-enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery (CyberC 2013). He is also a TPC member of many IEEE conferences and an active reviewer of several IEEE Transactions including IEEE Communications Letters, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology (TCSVT), IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications (TWC), IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology (TVT), and IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications (JSAC).
